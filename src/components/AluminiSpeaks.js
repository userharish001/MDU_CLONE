            I thank the University English Department Faculty and the Environment of the campus for shaping me and leading me to the position where I am today. I had done my Masters Programme in English from 1988 to 1990 from this university. I feel very happy and elated to be associated with this esteemed University. I am going to perform duties at such a level that all that I have learnt from here will be used to the best. I wish to thank all those who have been a part of my educational journey and influenced my life in every way. The way I have been prepared for my life here will take me a long way. Seeking your blessings for future endeavours! With best wishes.
